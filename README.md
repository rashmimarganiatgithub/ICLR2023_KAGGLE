Dealing with TUNIZI dialect compared to standard Arabic dialects motivates to present paper at ICLR 2023 workshop which deals with several challenges when building AI models for real world business problem. Some of these challenges include:

Limited Resources: There are relatively few resources available for training and testing AI models using Tunisian dialect compared to standard Arabic. This scarcity of resources makes it challenging to develop a model that can accurately recognize and understand the nuances of TUNIZI dialect.

Non-Standardized Grammar: TUNIZI dialect has its own unique grammar rules that differ from standard Arabic. For example, TUNIZI dialect has its own set of verb conjugations and sentence structures that may be unfamiliar to AI models trained on standard Arabic. This makes it challenging to accurately parse and analyze TUNIZI dialect text.

Dialectal Variation: There are also variations in the TUNIZI dialect itself, with differences in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation between different regions and communities within Tunisia. These variations make it challenging to develop a model that can accurately recognize and understand the nuances of TUNIZI dialect across different contexts.

Lack of Standardization: Unlike standard Arabic, TUNIZI dialect is not a standardized language, and there are no official rules governing its use. This makes it challenging to develop a consistent and accurate set of training data for AI models.

Code-Switching: In many contexts, TUNIZI speakers may switch between TUNIZI dialect and standard Arabic, making it challenging to accurately identify and analyze TUNIZI dialect text. This requires AI models to be trained on both TUNIZI dialect and standard Arabic in order to accurately recognize and understand code-switching.
